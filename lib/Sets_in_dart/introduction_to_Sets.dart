  // What is Set?

  // A set in Dart is an unordered collection of unique elements. This means that a set cannot contain duplicate values, and the ordering of elements is not guaranteed. Sets are useful when you need to store discrete items and efficiently perform operations such as membership, union, intersection, and difference testing.
  
  // Characteristics of a Set in Dart

/*1.Unordered Collection:

Sets do not maintain the order of elements. When you iterate over a set, the order in which the elements appear is not guaranteed to be the same as the order in which they were added.

2.Unique Elements:

A set cannot contain duplicate elements. If you try to add a duplicate element to a set, it will not be added.

3.Efficient Membership Checks:

Sets provide efficient methods for checking if an element is present. This makes sets useful for membership tests.

4.Iterable:

Sets in Dart are iterable, meaning you can use them in loops and other iterable contexts to access each element.*/
