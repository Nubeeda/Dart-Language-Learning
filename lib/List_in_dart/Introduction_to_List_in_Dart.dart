// List in dart
// In Dart, a List is an ordered collection of objects. It is a fundamental collection type used to store and manipulate a sequence of elements. Lists can grow or shrink in size dynamically and can contain elements of any type, although it is common to have lists with elements of a single type for type safety and consistency.
// var list = [1, 2, 3];

// Lists can be classified as −
//1. Fixed Length List
//2. Growable List
// 1. Fixed Length List

/*A fixed length list’s length cannot change at runtime. The syntax for creating a fixed length list is as given below −

Step 1 − Declaring a list

The syntax for declaring a fixed length list is given below −

var list_name = new List(initial_size)
The above syntax creates a list of the specified size. The list cannot grow or shrink at runtime. Any attempt to resize the list will result in an exception.

Step 2 − Initializing a list

The syntax for initializing a list is as given below −

 lst_name[index] = value;*/

 /*Growable List
A growable list’s length can change at run-time. The syntax for declaring and initializing a growable list is as given below −

Step 1 − Declaring a List

var list_name = [val1,val2,val3]   
--- creates a list containing the specified values  
OR  
var list_name = new List() 
--- creates a list of size zero 
Step 2 − Initializing a List

The index / subscript is used to reference the element that should be populated with a value. The syntax for initializing a list is as given below −

list_name[index] = value; */
