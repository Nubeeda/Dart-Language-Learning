  // Introduction to map

  // What is map?

  // In Dart, a Map is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique.

  // Maps are "useful" when you need to associate values with keys, allowing for efficient lookups, additions, and deletions based on the key. 

  //Let's explore the characteristics, creation, and usage of maps in Dart.

  // Characteristics of a Map in Dart

  /*
  1.Key-Value Pairs:

   A map consists of keys and their associated values.
   
  2.Unique Keys: 

Each key in a map must be unique. If you add a key that already exists, the value for that key is updated.

  3.Dynamic Size:

 Maps can grow and shrink dynamically as you add and remove key-value pairs.
