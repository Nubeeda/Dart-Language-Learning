// Why learn dart language
/*
Learning the Dart programming language can be beneficial for several reasons, especially for developers interested in creating mobile, web, and desktop applications. Here are some compelling reasons to learn darts:

Flutter Framework:

Cross-platform development: Dart is the language behind Flutter, Google's popular open source UI toolkit. With Flutter, you can build natively compiled applications for mobile (iOS and Android), web, and desktop from a single codebase.
Hot Reload: Dart offers Hot Reload with Flutter, which allows developers to see changes to the code immediately reflected in the application. This speeds up the development process significantly.

Performance:

Fast execution: Dart is also compiled to native code (ARM or x64) and JavaScript for web applications, ensuring high performance and quick startup times.
Ahead of Time (AOT) Compilation: Dart's AOT compilation produces fast, predictable, and high-performance apps, which is especially important for mobile devices.

Features of modern language:

Easy to learn: Dart's syntax is clean and easy to understand, especially for developers familiar with languages ​​like Java, JavaScript, or C#.
Asynchronous programming: Dart has built-in support for asynchronous programming with features like async/await, which makes it easy to write asynchronous code that is easy to read and maintain.

Tooling:

Excellent tooling: Dart offers strong tooling support, including a powerful command-line interface, package management via pub.dev, and excellent integration with popular IDEs such as IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio, and Visual Studio Code.
